<li>I love to be pet sitter for a summer during shs. My responsibilities included feeding, walking, and playing with dogs and cats while their owners were away. I also cleaned litter boxes and monitored the health and behavior of each pet to ensure they were happy and healthy. It was a great experience getting to spend time with so many different animals and seeing how much joy they bring to their owners' lives.
